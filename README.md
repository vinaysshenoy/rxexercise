# rxexercise
A set of exercises(in Kotlin) intended to introduce Rx newbies to Reactive concepts

## Usage
- Import the repository in IntelliJ Idea(Assuming IDE and JDK is already setup)
- All exercises are marked with numbers to be done in sequence, for example, `RxExercise01`, `RxExercise02` etc
- Run tests using either `./gradlew test` or via the IntelliJ test runner(Tests are written in Junit4)
- Implement the methods in the `RxExercise` sources to make the tests pass!
